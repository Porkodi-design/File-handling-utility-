ðŸ“„ Java Program Description: File Handling Utility

This Java program is a File Handling Utility that allows users to interact with text files through a console-based interface. It demonstrates how to perform essential file operations such as writing, reading, and modifying a file's content. The goal is to provide a clear and beginner-friendly example of Java's file I/O capabilities using BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, and exception handling.

Key Functionalities

1. Write to File
Prompts the user to enter a line of text, which is saved into a file (sample.txt). If the file doesnâ€™t exist, it is created automatically.
2. Read File Content
Displays the content of the file line-by-line using BufferedReader.
3. Modify File Content
Asks the user to provide a word to search and replace. It replaces all occurrences of the target word with a user-defined replacement using String.replaceAll() and updates the file.
4. Interactive CLI
The program guides the user through each step with clear prompts and emoji indicators for a friendly user experience.

Concepts Demonstrated

File creation and modification using:
FileWriter and BufferedWriter
FileReader and BufferedReader
Reading input from the user with Scanner
String manipulation (replaceAll)
Try-with-resources for safe file handling
